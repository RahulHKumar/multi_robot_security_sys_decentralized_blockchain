# multi_robot_security_sys_decentralized_blockchain
Multi robot systems are defined as a collection of two
or more robots that are capable of working autonomously while
coordinating with each other. Three challenges emerge while
designing any multi robot system. The robots have to coordinate
their path planning or trajectory planning in order to avoid
collision during the course of navigation, while collaborating
tasks with other robots to achieve a specific end goal for the
system. The other challenge, which is the focus of this paper, is
the security of the entire multi robot system. Since robots have
to coordinate with each other, any one of them being malicious
due to any kind of security threat, can lead to a chain reaction
that may compromise the entire system. Such security threats
can be fatal if not dealt with immediately. This paper proposes
the use of a Hybridized Blockchain Model (HBM) to identify
such security threats and take necessary actions in real time
so that the system does not encounter any catastrophic failure.
The proposed security architecture uses ROS (Robot operating
system) to decentralize the information collected by robot clients
and HBM to monitor the clients and take necessary real time
actions
